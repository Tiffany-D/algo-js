//Exercise 3.1

//Write a program that will add all the elements of an array.

//Test it with the following arrays:

//[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 15
//[100, 101, 102] => 303

//let arrOne =[1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

//arrOne.push(6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15);
//console.log(arrOne);

//Exercise 3.2

//Write a program that will calculate the average value of a given array.

//Test it with the following arrays:

//[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 3
//[100, 101, 102] => 101

//let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//console.log(arr[2]);

//let arrX = [100, 101, 102];
//console.log(arrX[101]);

//Exercise 3.3

//Write a program that will create a duplicate of a given array.

//Bonus: make a first version that will only do it using push(). Make a second version that uses a single method call to perform the copy. (You'll have to search on the MDN or Google for this one.)

//let originalArray = ["Blue", "Yellow", "Purple"];
//let copyArray= originalArray.slice();
//console.log(copyArray);

//let originalArray = ["Blue", "Yellow", "Purple"];
//originalArray.push= ("Blue", "Yellow", "Purple");
//console.log(originalArray);

//Exercise 3.4

//Write a program that will display the minimum and maximum elements of a given array.

//let array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//minValue= Math.min(...array);
//maxValue = Math.max(...array);
//console.log(minValue);
//console.log(maxValue);
